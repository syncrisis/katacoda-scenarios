Welcome!

This interactive guide will walk you through deploying a Python REST WebAPI through Kubernetes.  At the end of this guide, you should have a basic understanding of how to configure Kubernetes in your own projects.

The Python API will communicate with a mysql database on the backend for retrieving information.

For the source code used to build these containers is available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/syncrisis/kubernetesdemo)
