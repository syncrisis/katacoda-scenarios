Kubernetes is a tool created by Google for deploying containerized applications.

According to the [Kuberenetes Website](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/create-cluster/cluster-intro/):

> Kubernetes is a production-grade, open-source platform that orchestrates the placement (scheduling) and execution of application containers within and across computer clusters.

In other words, it is a way to deploy our containerized applications in a controlled way.
